  "description": "At the time, when laid-back West Coast G-funk ruled, the manic energy of this release - a seemingly infinite number of different rappers pouring out hallucinatory imagery; denser backing tracks than was believed possible in the 'all samples cleared' era - was shocking. Now that the group's innovations have been refined and copied so much, the disc doesn't pack quite the same punch. There are some wonderful eerie grooves ('Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber,' 'Protect Ya Neck'), first-rate rhyming ('Method Man'), and they're just about the only hip-hop act whose between-song skits are actually funny ('Clan In Da Front'). When they get serious, they can be devastating (the nostalgic 'Can It Be All So Simple'). And with so much talent on hand, the record never has a chance to get dull: even the minor tracks hold your attention ('Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing Ta F' Wit'). (DBW)"

  "description": "Right away, a side project: RZA plus Poetic, De La Soul's Prince Paul and Frukwan. It's ultraviolent in the horror style pioneered, I believe, by the Geto Boys - which is to say, it's like a rap version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, plenty of murder and mayhem spiced with the occasional occult reference. The blood and guts preoccupation gets old real fast, but taken individually many of the tracks are effective, and the furiously paced, genuinely scary 'Diary Of A Madman' is perhaps the masterpiece of the genre. That track is RZA's, but most of the disc is produced by Prince Paul, and he makes some interesting choices: the mellow soul groove of '1-800 SUICIDE' only makes the gleefully demented vocals more disturbing; the brief 'Mommy, What's A Gravedigga?' makes good use of an obscure Patrice Rushen sample; the dense, wordless 'Rest In Peace (Outro)' is fascinating. RZA does contribute the title track, which is so weirdly out of tune it sounds like a put-on, and the routine 'Graveyard Chamber.' You're unlikely to keep this in heavy rotation unless you're an Omen fan, and it's not like any other Wu-associated offering, but the witty, unpredictable rhyming and offbeat production make this a worth a listen... borrow it from a friend.

  "description": "First, the music: RZA's thick stew of samples, beats and found sounds is masterful throughout (title track, 'I Get My Thang In Action'), as even the simpler tracks are powerful and original ('Sub Crazy'). Blue Raspberry's belted chorus on 'Release Yo' Delf' (the first of her many appearances on backing vocals) and diva vocals on 'Stimulation' are among the high points. As for Meth, I must be missing something: he's the most respected of all the Wu rappers, and his voice has a lot of tonal variety: he sounds so different from track to track - low-key and groggy on 'Biscuits,' forceful and focused on 'I Get My Thang In Action,' tender like LL on 'All I Need' - you'll wonder if it's all the same person. But his rhymes are often obvious and clich√©-filled - there's enough 'y'know wh' I'm sayin',' 'keepin' it real' and 'represent' for five albums - and scattershot, without the intriguing pet themes of the other members. Thus, the most enjoyable track is probably 'Mr. Sandman,' with its profusion of guest rappers (RZA, Inspectah Deck, Street Thug and Carlton Fisk - no, not the ballplayer - who almost steals the show) - though Raekwon's guest appearance ('Meth Vs. Chef') is dull. Everything's produced by RZA, but 4th Disciple gets a co-producing credit for 'Sub Crazy,' and Meth gets one for 'P.L.O. Style' (which has nothing to do with the P.L.O., if you're wondering). The remix version of 'All I Need' (based on Ashford & Simpson's 'You're All I Need To Get By') featuring Mary J. Blige was a major hit. Too bad it's not on the album, though there is a fine remix of the earlier Wu-Tang single 'Method Man.' (DBW)"
